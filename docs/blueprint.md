# **App Name**: Decision Points

## Core Features:

- Authentication: Secure user authentication and authorization using NextAuth.
- Stripe Integration: Integrate Stripe for subscription management and automated user payouts via Stripe Connect.
- Zero-Touch Onboarding: Implement a zero-touch onboarding process, allowing users to optionally set a risk profile or income goal; otherwise, default to a balanced approach.
- Observational Dashboard: Develop an observational dashboard to provide real-time insights into the AI's strategies, income streams, and resource allocation.
- Autonomous Strategy Orchestration: Develop an Orchestrator AI tool that proactively identifies income opportunities, dynamically adapts strategies, and autonomously allocates resources using the Google Gemini API.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep charcoal (#333333) with subtle hints of inferno orange (#FF4500) for a sophisticated, yet ominous feel.
- Secondary color: Dark, metallic grey (#4A4A4A) to represent the cold, unyielding nature of the underworld.
- Accent: A restrained crimson (#8B0000) used sparingly to draw attention to critical alerts and important data points.
- Clean, modern sans-serif fonts with a slightly condensed style to convey efficiency and a subtle sense of unease.
- Minimalist icons with sharp edges and subtle fiery gradients to evoke infernal imagery in a professional manner.
- A structured, grid-based layout with dark backgrounds and clearly defined sections to maintain a sense of order within the chaotic theme.
- Subtle, smoky transitions and occasional ember-like particles to create a sense of depth and subtle visual interest without being distracting.

App Name: Decision Points

Core Concept: Engineer a fully autonomous AI ecosystem designed to independently generate and grow passive income streams for users. Users subscribe via Stripe, primarily granting authorization and providing payout mechanisms. Post-authorization, the system operates with minimal-to-zero human intervention. It utilizes a self-directed Multi-Agent AI System, leveraging models via Google Gemini API, to proactively identify opportunities, strategize, execute, monitor, and adapt income-generating activities, aiming for self-optimizing cash flow and revenue growth.

AI System Architecture:

	Orchestrator Agent Implementation:
    	Develop a central Orchestrator AI with significant autonomy.
    	Capabilities:
        	Proactive Opportunity Analysis: Continuously scan markets, trends, and data sources to autonomously identify and evaluate new passive income opportunities without user prompting.
        	Dynamic & Adaptive Strategy: Formulate, deploy, and continuously adapt income strategies based on real-time performance data, market shifts, and predictive analytics. Automatically selects niches, models (affiliate, digital products, etc.), and platforms.
        	Autonomous Resource Allocation: Intelligently allocate system resources (e.g., API budgets, compute) across various Action Agents and income streams based on projected ROI and performance.
        	Self-Optimizing Decision Making: Implement learning loops where the Orchestrator refines its strategic approach based on the success/failure of past actions.
    	LLM Backend: Utilize models via OpenRouter or Google Gemini API for high-level reasoning, strategic planning, adaptation, and instruction generation.
	"Action" Agent Swarm Framework:
    	Build a flexible framework to manage a dynamic swarm of specialized Action Agents.
    	Agent Autonomy: Empower Action Agents with more decision-making power within their task domains (e.g., optimizing content variations autonomously via A/B testing, attempting self-correction on task failures before escalating).
    	LLM Usage: Ensure Action Agents leverage specified LLMs (OpenRouter/Gemini) for sophisticated task execution.
    	Dynamic Tasking: Action Agents pull tasks assigned by the Orchestrator, execute them, and report rich data back, fueling the Orchestrator's adaptation loop.
    	Potential for Dynamic Agent Spawning: Design architecture anticipating the possibility for the Orchestrator to request the instantiation of new agent types if its strategy requires novel capabilities.
    	Initial Action Agent Capabilities: Market Analysis, Advanced Content Generation (multi-format?), Automated Platform Deployment/Interaction, Dynamic Monetization Optimization, Performance Analytics & Feedback.
	Closed-Loop Workflow & Communication:
    	Implement a highly automated workflow focusing on seamless data flow from Action Agents back to the Orchestrator, enabling rapid feedback cycles and strategy adjustments without human bottlenecks.

User-Facing Features (Designed for Observation, Not Intervention):

	Authentication: Secure user sign-up/login.
	Stripe Integration: Seamless subscription management and crucially, setup for automated user payouts (e.g., Stripe Connect requiring minimal user action post-initial link).
	Zero-Touch Onboarding: User interaction post-auth should be minimized to potentially setting an optional high-level risk profile or income goal (e.g., "Stable Growth," "Aggressive Expansion"), otherwise the system defaults to a balanced approach. The primary action is authorizing the system and linking payout info.
	Observational Dashboard:
    	Provide real-time insights into the autonomous operations: View the Orchestrator's current strategy, active income streams, resource allocation, and key decisions.
